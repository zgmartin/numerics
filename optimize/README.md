Minimization:
-------------

The goal of minimization is to search for the smallest value over the global space. Selecting the right direction to move is important in finding the minimum value. 

Localized search can be performed to move towards selecting a minimum, but runs into the problem of getting stuck smallest spot.

A global transition can be applied to break out from the localized position with the hope of finding a global minimum. 


Annealing:
----------

>When I first heard about simulated annealing it caused me to think about how I solved problems, rarely through a rationally deductive process. Instead I value a free association of ideas, a jumble of three or four ideas bouncing around in my head. As the urge for resolution increases, the bouncing around stops and I settle on just one idea or strategy as the best. Likewise when I feel my actions are in a rut, I introduce a chaotic element - undertake a random action, like seeking out a new person, group, or meeting, without trying to justify it in terms of my existing values. It is usually a learning experience, if for no other reason than to show me that I am not in a rut after all. Adopting metaphors from science for our own life can change the way we think and act.

The concepts within annealing were first proposed as an idea by Metropolis in understanding state changes of particles while working on the Manhattan Project.
