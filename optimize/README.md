Annealing:
----------

>When I first heard about simulated annealing it caused me to think about how I solved problems, rarely through a rationally deductive process. Instead I value a free association of ideas, a jumble of three or four ideas bouncing around in my head. As the urge for resolution increases, the bouncing around stops and I settle on just one idea or strategy as the best. Likewise when I feel my actions are in a rut, I introduce a chaotic element - undertake a random action, like seeking out a new person, group, or meeting, without trying to justify it in terms of my existing values. It is usually a learning experience, if for no other reason than to show me that I am not in a rut after all. Adopting metaphors from science for our own life can change the way we think and act.
